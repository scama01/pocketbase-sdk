# PocketBase SDK

##### Even though the [official SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk) is amazing, I had my own set of problems with the way it was organized and how it was working, so I tried to build my own version (almost)\* from scratch.

###### \* Auth implementation copied from the [official SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk) as i was too dumb to make it myself.

###### Documentation may also look a little bit the same as the official one as the functionality is almost the same.
